# Testing and coverage

Run all local checks from the repository root:

```bash
bash build.sh
bash test.sh
python3 scripts/check-docs.py
python3 scripts/check-privacy.py
bash scripts/check-style.sh
```

The Java coverage task measures the pure settings resolver, provider-value validator, and aspect-ratio bounds for the full-screen shader geometry. JaCoCo requires 100% line and branch coverage for those classes. The installer has a separate 100% line and branch coverage gate. Android framework, OpenGL calls, and shaders are not executed by the host JVM; they are checked through APK metadata inspection, emulator installation, settings interaction, provider query/update, and inspected screenshots. The emulator image used for this project does not expose an idle DreamService activation route, so activation is not claimed as tested.

The tests check supported and unknown setting values, individual and global randomization, checksum parsing and rejection, release URL restrictions, trusted redirect handling, ambiguous devices, cancellation, explicit serial selection, install/update, and protected non-interactive uninstall. They do not claim physical vendor-menu or 4K hardware coverage.
